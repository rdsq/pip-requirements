# Pip Requirements

This extension simplifies commands like `pip install` and `pip freeze` and puts them behind a few buttons on your workbench (or Command Palette)

## Usage

It is very simple: just open a **requirements.txt** file in VS Code, and you'll see buttons to **install** or **freeze** the packages

You can also do it by right clicking on a requirements file in the file explorer
